# Pareidolia

Pareidolia is a toolkit for detecting changes in pattern intensities from Hi-C maps. It can be used to compare samples from different conditions and use multiple replicates to improve results. 

This toolkit works directly on chromosight's correlation maps, allowing the same method to detect changes in different Hi-C patterns (e.g. loops or borders).
